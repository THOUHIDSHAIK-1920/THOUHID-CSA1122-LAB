1.2 PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND PROJECT PLANNING 
E-book Management System gives an idea about how books are maintained in the 
particular websites. The books that are to be purchased, the books that are to be sold are 
maintained here. . Further some additional details of the current books that is available in the 
store are also given. E book Management System in this project is done in an authorized way. 
The password and user id has been set here.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
This software is designed to manage the books that were read through the internet. This 
consists of the details of the e-book that were read by the user online. It will be controlled by the 
central system. This system act as a backup of all details together.

 STATECHART DIAGRAM:
 It is a technique to describe the behavior of the system. It describes all the possible states 
that a particular object gets into the object oriented technique. State diagram are drawn for a 
single class to show to the lifetime behaviour of a single objects.

 COMPONENT DIAGRAM:
 The component diagram is represented by figure dependency and it is a graph of design 
of figure dependency. The component diagram's main purpose is to show the structural 
relationships between the components of a systems. It is represented by boxed figure. 
Dependencies are represented by communication association.

 DEPLOYMENT DIAGRAM:
 A deployment diagram in the unified modeling language serves to model the physical 
deployment of artifacts on deployment targets. Deployment diagrams show "the allocation of 
artifacts to nodes according to the Deployments defined between them. It is represented by 3- 
dimentional box. Dependencies are represented by communication association

 PACKAGE DIAGRAM:
 payment
 A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies 
between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping of 
elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML. PDs can be used to show groups 
of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in Component Diagrams 
(CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs).
